	 *   3. An interface can extends to another interface
	 *   4. An interface can not implements another interface or class
	 *   5. A class can extends to a another class
	 *   6. A  class can not extends more than one class at a time
	 *   7. An interface can extends more than one interface at a time
	 *   8. A class can  not implements another class.
	 *   9. A class can extends toa single class and at the same time it can implement a interface too
