	 *    Abstract class
	 *    -----------------
	 *    -> Abstract class contains zero or more abstract methods and concrete methods
	 *    -> Abstract method is a method specification. Sub classes should implement it
	 *    -> We can not create an object to a Abstract class
	 *    -> Any class extending an abstract class, must overrride all the abstract methods.
	 *    -> If a class is not overring any one of the abstract method, then that class 
	 *       must be defines as 'abstract'
	 *    -> We can create a referenceto an abstract class.
	 *    -> reference of an abstract class can be used to store or hold all its sub class 
	 *       objects
	 *    -> Abstract class reference can be used to access all the methods in the abstract 
	 *       class and overridden methods from the sub class
	 *    -> Abstart clas reference caqn not be used to access the individual methods in the 
	 *       sub class (a method which present obky in the sub class and not available in
	 *       the abstract class
	 *    -> A class can be defined either as 'abstract' or 'final' both can not done at same time
